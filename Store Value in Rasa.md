how to store value input in rasa

To store values input in Rasa, you can use slots. Slots are a special type of variable that can be used to store values within a conversation. They can be defined in your domain file and then set within your stories or actions. To set the value of a slot, you can use the `tracker.slots` dictionary and set the key of the desired slot to the desired value. For example:

makefile

```makefile
# In the domain file
slots:
  name:
    type: text

# In an action or story
slot_values = tracker.get_slot("name")
slot_values["name"] = "John Doe"

# In a different action or story
name = tracker.get_slot("name")
print("The stored name is: ", name)
```

This way, you can store values input by the user and access them later in the conversation.
