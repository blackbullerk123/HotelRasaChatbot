> To create a datepicker in Rasa, you'll need to create a custom action that returns a datepicker message to the user. You can use a messaging platform like Facebook or Slack, which provide native support for datepickers, or you can use a library like `python-dateutil` to format the date and return it as a text message.

> ```python
> from rasa_sdk import Action, Tracker
> from rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher
> from rasa_sdk.forms import FormAction
> import datetime
> 
> class DatePickerForm(FormAction):
> 
>     def name(self):
>         return "date_picker_form"
> 
>     @staticmethod
>     def required_slots(tracker):

>         return {
>             "start_date": [self.from_entity(entity="time", role="from"), self.from_text()],
>             "end_date": [self.from_entity(entity="time", role="to"), self.from_text()],
>         }
> 
>     def submit(self, dispatcher, tracker, domain):
>         start_date = tracker.get_slot("start_date")
>         end_date = tracker.get_slot("end_date")
> 
>         start_date = datetime.datetime.strptime(start_date, '%Y-%m-%d').date()
>         end_date = datetime.datetime.strptime(end_date, '%Y-%m-%d').date()
> 
>         response = "Start date: {} End date: {}".format(start_date, end_date)
>         dispatcher.utter_message(response)
> 
>         return []
> ```

> In this example, the `DatePickerForm` is a `FormAction` that collects two slots: `start_date` and `end_date`. The `slot_mappings` method maps entities with the `time` type and roles `from` and `to` to the `start_date` and `end_date` slots, respectively. The `submit` method is called when all required slots have been filled and converts the dates to a `datetime` object, formats them as a string, and returns a message to the user.
> 
> You'll also need to update your `actions` in the `config.yml` file to include the custom action:
> 
> yaml
> 
> ```yaml
> actions:
> - date_picker_form
> ```
