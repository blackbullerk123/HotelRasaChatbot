> Handle phone number input in rasa
> 
> You can handle phone number input in Rasa using the following steps:
> 
> 1.  Define a custom slot type for phone numbers in your domain file:
> 
> yaml
> 
> ```yaml
> slot_types:
>   phone_number:
>     type: text
>     example: [{"value": "555-555-5555"}]
> ```
> 
> 2.  Use the custom slot type in your Rasa stories:
> 
> markdown
> 
> ```markdown
> ## story_example
> * greet
>   - utter_greet
> * request_phone_number
>   - utter_ask_for_phone_number
> * provide_phone_number
>   - slot{"phone_number": "555-555-5555"}
>   - utter_acknowledge_phone_number
> ```
> 
> 3.  Train your model using the custom slot type and the stories you've defined:
> 
> `rasa train`
> 
> 4.  Use the `InputEntity` action in your action file to extract the phone number from the user's input:
> 
> python
> 
> ```python
> from rasa_sdk import Action, Tracker
> from rasa_sdk.events import SlotSet
> 
> class ExtractPhoneNumber(Action):
>     def name(self):
>         return "action_extract_phone_number"
> 
>     def run(self, dispatcher, tracker, domain):
>         phone_number = tracker.get_slot("phone_number")
>         if phone_number:
>             return [SlotSet("phone_number", phone_number)]
>         else:
>             dispatcher.utter_message("Could not extract phone number")
>             return []
> ```
> 
> 5.  Call the `InputEntity` action in your stories, just before setting the phone number slot:
> 
> markdown
> 
> ```markdown
> ## story_example
> * greet
>   - utter_greet
> * request_phone_number
>   - utter_ask_for_phone_number
> * extract_phone_number
>   - action_extract_phone_number
> * provide_phone_number
>   - slot{"phone_number": "555-555-5555"}
>   - utter_acknowledge_phone_number
> ```
> 
> That's it! Now your Rasa model should be able to handle phone number inputs from users.
> 
> list all format of phone number
> 
> Phone numbers can be formatted in a variety of ways, but some of the most common formats include:
> 
> 1.  (555) 555-5555
> 2.  555-555-5555
> 3.  555.555.5555
> 4.  555 555 5555
> 5.  +1 555 555 5555
> 6.  1-555-555-5555
> 7.  1 (555) 555-5555
> 8.  5555555555
> 
> It's important to note that phone number formats can vary depending on the country. For example, in some countries, phone numbers are written with a different number of digits and may or may not include punctuation. Additionally, the international format (e.g., +1 555 555 5555) is becoming more widely used as more people communicate with people from other countries.

> list all email format
> 
> There are several common email address formats, including:
> 
> 1.  [username@domain.com](mailto:username@domain.com)
> 2.  [first.last@domain.com](mailto:first.last@domain.com)
> 3.  [first\_last@domain.com](mailto:first_last@domain.com)
> 4.  [username@subdomain.domain.com](mailto:username@subdomain.domain.com)
> 5.  [username+tag@domain.com](mailto:username+tag@domain.com)
> 
> It's important to note that the format of an email address can vary depending on the email service provider and the individual's personal preferences. However, all email addresses must contain the "@" symbol and a valid domain name (e.g., `domain.com`).

> Here are some examples of intent inputs for phone numbers:
> 
> 1.  "My phone number is 555-555-5555."
> 2.  "Can I give you my phone number? It's (555) 555-5555."
> 3.  "My number is 555 555 5555."
> 4.  "You can reach me at 555.555.5555."
> 5.  "The best way to reach me is at +1 555 555 5555."
> 6.  "My contact number is 1-555-555-5555."
> 7.  "You can call me at 1 (555) 555-5555."
> 8.  "Here's my number: 5555555555."
> 
> These examples show how users might express their phone number as part of a conversation. Your model should be able to extract the phone number from the user's input and save it to a slot.

> Here are some common country codes used in international phone numbers:
> 
> 1.  +1 for the United States and Canada

> 
> These are just a few examples of country codes. There are many more country codes, and they can be used to format international phone numbers. For example, a phone number in the United States might be written as +1 555 555 5555, while a phone number in the United Kingdom might be written as +44 20 555 555 555.
