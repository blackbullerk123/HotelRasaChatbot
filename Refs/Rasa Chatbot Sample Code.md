write sample code rasa chatbot for book hotel room

Here's a sample code for a Rasa chatbot that helps users book a hotel room:

makefile

```makefile
# Define the stories for the booking process
stories = [
    {
        "story": "book_hotel_room",
        "steps": [
            {
                "intent": "greet",
                "action": "utter_greet"
            },
            {
                "intent": "affirm",
                "action": "utter_ask_location"
            },
            {
                "intent": "provide_location",
                "action": "action_store_location"
            },
            {
                "intent": "affirm",
                "action": "utter_ask_dates"
            },
            {
                "intent": "provide_dates",
                "action": "action_store_dates"
            },
            {
                "intent": "affirm",
                "action": "utter_ask_room_type"
            },
            {
                "intent": "provide_room_type",
                "action": "action_store_room_type"
            },
            {
                "intent": "affirm",
                "action": "utter_confirm_booking"
            },
            {
                "intent": "affirm",
                "action": "action_book_room"
            },
            {
                "intent": "deny",
                "action": "utter_ask_changes"
            },
            {
                "intent": "provide_changes",
                "action": "action_store_changes"
            },
            {
                "intent": "affirm",
                "action": "utter_confirm_booking"
            },
            {
                "intent": "affirm",
                "action": "action_book_room"
            }
        ]
    }
]

# Define the actions the bot will perform
actions = [
    "utter_greet",
    "utter_ask_location",
    "action_store_location",
    "utter_ask_dates",
    "action_store_dates",
    "utter_ask_room_type",
    "action_store_room_type",
    "utter_confirm_booking",
    "action_book_room",
    "utter_ask_changes",
    "action_store_changes"
]

# Define the intents the bot will recognize
intents = [
    "greet",
    "affirm",
    "provide_location",
    "provide_dates",
    "provide_room_type",
    "deny"
]

# Define the utterances for each intent
utterances = {
    "greet": [
        "Hi",
        "Hello",
        "Hey",
        "Hi there"
    ],
    "affirm": [
        "yes",
        "yeah",
        "yep",
        "sure",
        "of course"
    ],
    "provide_location": [
        "I want to book a room in {location}",
        "I'd like to book a room in {location}"
    ],
    "provide_dates": [
        "I want to book a room from {start_date}
```

continue to write sample code please

Certainly, here's the continuation of the sample code:

css

```css
to {end_date}",
        "I'd like to book a room from {start_date} to {end_date}"
    ],
    "provide_room_type": [
        "I want a {room_type} room",
        "I'd like a {room_type} room"
    ],
    "deny": [
        "no",
        "nope",
        "not really",
        "not yet",
        "no thanks"
    ]
}

# Define the custom actions and their implementations
def action_store_location(location):
    return {"location": location}

def action_store_dates(start_date, end_date):
    return {"start_date": start_date, "end_date": end_date}

def action_store_room_type(room_type):
    return {"room_type": room_type}

def action_book_room(location, start_date, end_date, room_type):
    # Implementation to book a room using the provided information
    # This implementation is not shown here but can be done using a hotel booking API or database
    pass

# Train the Rasa chatbot using the defined stories, actions, intents, and utterances
model = RasaModel(stories, actions, intents, utterances)
model.train()

# Start the Rasa chatbot
bot = RasaChatBot(model)
bot.start()
```

This code will define a chatbot that greets the user, asks for the location, dates, and room type they want to book a room in, confirms the booking, and books the room if confirmed. The implementation for actually booking the room is not shown here, but can be done using a hotel booking API or database.

nice try
